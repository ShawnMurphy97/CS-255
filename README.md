//Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Through this course we were asked to design a system called DriverPass. This system was created in order to solve the issue of new drivers not receiving adequate education on the subject resulting in a statistic of 65% of new drivers failing the driving test at the DMV.

//What did you do particularly well?
My personal strength in this course I believe was the construction of the diagrams, this was the UML Use Case, Activity, Sequence, and the Class diagrams. Particularly I believe my UML Activity Diagrams were the most well constructed and am happy with how they turned out.

//If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I believe I could work on my ability to design UML Class diagrams as out of all the diagrams this was what I felt was the most poor. This would be done primarily through showing how each class is related to the other.

//How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it important to consider the user's needs when designing?
The needs of the user molded what my design was throughout the entire process. I designed each of my diagrams with the various user interactions in mind. If the user needs are not considered when designing a system, then the system itself will remain too broad and not really solve many of the issues that the system was originally commissioned to solve.

//How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
What I have learned is that using a repititious approach will allow me to get a rough draft so to say of the design out and then repeat through and refine the small details. This helps with smoothing out the process and ultimately increasing the work speed. In the future I would use this iterative approach and refining my ability at it in order to provide much more detailed and refined designs.
